[362 - 363] FINISH_TRAY_MOVE_IN
    Move the homing check for the gantries to occur after they have run through all of their positions.
    On the other hand, the gantries should already be at 0,0 here so maybe it isn't worth moving.

[446] FINISH_PICTURE
    I noticed that the NEXT_PICTURE case instructions are duplicated in FINISH_PICTURE in a way that doesn't make sense. 
    I need to correct this in the main programming.
